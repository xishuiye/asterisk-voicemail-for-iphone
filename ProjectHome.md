# Asterisk Voicemail for iPhone #

**Asterisk Voicemail for iPhone** allows you to check your voicemail messages on your Asterisk phone system from your iPhone (or iPod Touch). It has been suggested that I rename the software to something more generic, since the iPod Touch is also fully supported. Something like "Asterisk Voicemail for Apple Touch". Thoughts?

It works similar to the native iPhone Visual Voicemail, allowing you to list messages, listen to messages, display caller-id information, delete messages, move messages, return calls and change voicemail settings all from your iPhone.

The technology behind it is Asterisk (The Open-Source VoIP PBX), PHP for the backend, Smarty and iUI for the frontend.

## Before you download ##

Understand what this software is. It is a PHP web-application which resides on your Asterisk server. Don't be confused into thinking that this is a native iPhone application. If you don't run or manage an Asterisk server, then this is not for you.

## Project Status ##

This software is at an Beta stage. Most features are complete.
